## Project Overview
For this project, we aim to determine the **best nieghborhood in Pittsburgh** using data analysis techniques in Python. The metric we chose to define "bestness" is **Quality of Life**. The sub metric that Kadair chose was **crime rate** (measured by the number of incidents reported in each neighborhood), Alex chose the percentage of average quality of buildings, and Rohan selected the council district corresponding to the neighborhood with the highest number of non-traffic citations.


## Datasets Used
**Kadair Walker**
- **Dataset Name:** Pittsburgh Crime Data
- **Source:** Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)
- **Link:** [Police Incident Blotter (ARCHIVED)](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data)

**Rohan Shrestha**
- **Dataset Name:** Non traffic Citation

- **Description:** This dataset contains records of non-traffic citations (NTCs), also known as summary offenses, issued by the City of Pittsburgh Police. These citations document low-level criminal offenses such as disorderly conduct, loitering, harassment, and retail theft, typically resulting in a fine rather than arrest. The dataset includes only cases handled by the City of Pittsburgh Police and excludes those involving other law enforcement agencies within the city. It does not include racial data for individuals identified as Latino. Data collection ended on November 14, 2023, with the transition to a new records management system.
